# This is a PowerBI project, created three dashboards.
```
**I used the DAX feature in PowerBI to do my calculations.
I did calculations like Debt- to- equity ratio, Cash ratio, working capital and current ratio
I also derived insights like 
The working capital by year
The total asset by year
Total investments
Liabilities by year.
I visualized the insights and created an interactive dashboard 
I used bar charts, area chart and pie chart
For the interactive part I added slicer to see the visualization by year
I also added a page navigator to go through the three dashboards; Health, Growth and insight**
